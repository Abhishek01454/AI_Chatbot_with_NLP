# Chatbot for University Project

This chatbot project was developed as part of my university project. The goal of the project was to create an interactive chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Technologies Used

The chatbot is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- Python: The programming language used for the implementation of the chatbot logic.
- Jupyter Notebook: The development environment for writing and testing the code.
- TensorFlow: The deep learning framework used for training and deploying the NLP model.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API used for building and training the model.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- TensorBoard: A visualization tool for monitoring the training process and model performance.
- Git: Version control system for tracking code changes and collaboration.

## Logic and Functionality

The chatbot follows a rule-based approach using intents and responses. The logic of the chatbot is as follows:

1. Preprocessing: The input text is cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization and stemming.
2. Intent Classification: The preprocessed text is classified into different intents using a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset. The model predicts the most suitable intent for the input text.
3. Response Generation: Once the intent is identified, the chatbot retrieves a set of predefined responses associated with that intent. A random response is selected and displayed as the chatbot's reply.

The model used in the chatbot is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of user queries and their corresponding intents. The training involves converting the text data into numerical representations, defining a neural network architecture, and optimizing the model parameters using gradient descent.

The chatbot can handle a variety of user queries related to different topics or tasks, thanks to the defined intents and associated responses. If a user query does not match any predefined intent, the chatbot provides a default response to indicate that it doesn't understand the input.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook file or execute the Python script containing the chatbot code.
3. Interact with the chatbot by typing in your queries or messages when prompted.
4. The chatbot will process your input, classify the intent, and generate a suitable response based on the identified intent.

Feel free to modify the intents, responses, and training data to customize the chatbot's behavior according to your needs.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential areas for future enhancements and improvements:

- Adding more intents and responses to make the chatbot more versatile.
- Implementing advanced NLP techniques such as named entity recognition or sentiment analysis to enhance the chatbot's understanding and response generation.
- Integrating the chatbot with external APIs or databases to provide more dynamic and real-time information.
- Deploying the chatbot as a web application or integrating it into existing platforms for wider accessibility.
